# **Queue Management System**

Welcome to the **Queue Management System**! This project demonstrates how to implement a robust queue management system to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently.

## **Project Overview**

The **Queue Management System** is designed to manage and process tasks asynchronously using a queuing mechanism. This allows for the efficient handling of background jobs, such as sending emails or processing large data sets, without blocking the main application flow.

## **Features**

- **Asynchronous Task Processing**: Offload long-running tasks to be processed in the background.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily scale up the number of workers to handle increased task volume.
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retry and error handling for failed tasks.
- **Flexible Queueing**: Support for various queuing strategies and backends.
